2022-09-18,JobsInLogistics.com,35F Intelligence Analyst,"Washington, PA","Job Description


Job Description:

On the battlefield, success depends on accurate and timely intel. As an Army National Guard Intelligence Analyst, you will play a key role in the interpretation and exploitation of information gathered from or about the threat. Intelligence Analysts provide Guard personnel with information about enemy forces and potential battle areas, and use information derived from all intelligence disciplines to determine changes in enemy capabilities, vulnerabilities, and probable courses of action. You'll gain Military Intelligence training, education, and a security clearance that could open doors to rewarding career opportunities with other intelligence agencies.

Specific duties of the Intelligence Analyst may include: preparing all-source intelligence products; providing Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Synchronization support; processing incoming reports and messages; determining the significance and reliability of incoming information; establishing and maintaining systematic, cross-referencing intelligence records and files; integrating incoming information with current intelligence holdings; and preparing and maintaining enemy situational graphics.










More than any other branch of service, the Army National Guard offers a wide range of intelligence-related positions. Through your training, you will develop skills and experience to create opportunities for a civilian career with federal agencies like the National Security Agency.




Instead of paying to learn these skills, get paid to learn. In the Army National Guard, you will learn these valuable job skills while earning a regular paycheck and qualifying for tuition assistance and certifications. Job training for an Intelligence Analyst consists of 10 weeks of Basic Training, where you'll learn basic Soldiering skills, and 13 weeks of Advanced Individual Training (AIT) and on-the-job instruction, including practice in intelligence gathering. You'll learn in the classroom and gain experience in the field. Completion of your initial entry training in the Army National Guard could also lead to additional college credit.







Most non-prior service candidates will initially earn between $200 and $250 per drill weekend, subject to change.




Requires military enlistment. Programs and benefits are subject to change. Ask your Army National Guard recruiter for the most up-to-date information. Actual MOS assignment may depend on MOS availability.
